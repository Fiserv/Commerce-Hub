# Accept wallet payments

Commerce Hub integrates with popular mobile and digital wallet providers, including Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Paze.

Wallet transactions can originate from a digital wallet on a website or a device (e.g., Apple/iOS, Google/Android, and Samsung). Merchants can submit this data as either an encrypted or decrypted request.

- **Encrypted wallet:** The merchant sends the encrypted data along with their private key. Commerce Hub decrypts the information for processing.
- **Decrypted wallet:** The merchant decrypts the wallet data before submitting it to Commerce Hub for processing.

> We are enhancing Commerce Hub to include support for additional wallets including Samsung Pay, PayPal and Amazon Pay. The documents related to the features will be released soon.
