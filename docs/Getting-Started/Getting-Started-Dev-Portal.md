# Getting Started with Developer Studio

Developer Studio is the developer portal built by Fiserv to allow integration with Commerce Hub's APIs. Within Developer Studio, you can access our APIs, obtain authentication credentials, build integrations and test them before launching to market.

#### Access Commerce Hub APIs

Follow the below steps to get an access to the Developer Studio and use Commerce Hub's APIs.

To create an account in Developer Studio, you will need the following:

- Account information
- Valid business e-mail address
- Access Token (for a certification or production MIDs)

## Step 1: Sign up for  Developer Studio

Request and [create a developer account](https://developer.fiserv.com/support/docs/?path=docs/guides/create-account.md) in Developer Studio.
