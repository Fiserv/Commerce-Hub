<!-- theme: danger -->
> We are enhancing Commerce Hub to include Connected Commerce support and the documents related to the features will be released soon.

Connected Commerce also known as Universal Commerce or Omnicommerce is Commerce Hub's unified commerce solution that consolidates sales channels, and allows for a more consistent and personalized customer experience.

Connected Commerce is based around the concept of recognizing your customers when they purchase online, in-app, or in-person with any Commerce Hub integration.
