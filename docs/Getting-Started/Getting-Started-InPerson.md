# In-Person Payments

Commerce Hub supports in-person or card present payment transactions where the customer physically presents the payment source while making a transaction at any merchant terminal. This type of transcation can include swiping a card with a magnetic strip, inserting or tapping a card with an [EMV chip](?path=docs/Resources/FAQs-Glossary/Glossary.md#emv), or tapping a mobile device with the card loaded to a digital wallet.

## Integrations

Commerce Hub allows a merchant to build their own UI and manage customer transactions within their own software or terminal using Commerce Hub's RESTful APIs.
