# Smart Routing

<!-- theme: danger -->
> We are enhancing Commerce Hub to include support of smart routing for debit transactions. The documents related to this feature will be released soon.

Smart routing consists of working with multiple payment service providers in order to be able to use the most relevant one for a single transaction. All of this for live transactions and with it being fully transparent to the shopper.
