# Encrypted PIN Pad Integration

The PIN Pad or device used to capture the payment source is connected to the terminal or software. The terminal or software initiates the RESTful API transaction with the encrypted payment source from the 3rd party device. 

Commerce Hub supports the following encrypted payment source types: EMV chip and PIN, track data (magstripe), NFC/contactless, and manual entry.

**Begin integration with Commerce Hub's [RESTful APIs](?path=docs/Resources/API-Documents/Use-Our-APIs.md).**
