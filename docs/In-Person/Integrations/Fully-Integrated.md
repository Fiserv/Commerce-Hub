# Fully-Integrated Device

<!-- theme: danger -->
> We are enhancing Commerce Hub to include fully-integrated device support and the documents related to the features will be released soon.

Commerce Hub's fully-integrated payment system efficiently manages all the processes by a single integrated system. It has the payment application as a part of the core POS solution. The software handles every aspect of the transaction, from scanning and reading the bar code to processing the payments and managing inventory and replenishment. All card payment activity is handled by the POS terminal from entering the cardholder data to the close of the sale, all in a matter of seconds.
