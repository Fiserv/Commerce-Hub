# Tap to Pay on iPhone

<!-- theme: danger -->
> We are enhancing Commerce Hub and the documents related to this features will be released soon.

[Tap to Pay on iPhone](?path=https://developer.apple.com/tap-to-pay/) allows merchant's to accept contactless payments using a [supported iPhone](https://register.apple.com/tap-to-pay-on-iphone/faq) or a partner-enabled iOS app. Tap to Pay allows the merchant's app to accept payments from contactless credit or debit cards, Apple Pay, Apple Watch, and smartphones with other digital wallets. No additional hardware is required to accept contactless payments through Tap to Pay on iPhone, so merchant's can accept payments from anywhere. 

### How it Works

1. The merchant intiates a transaction from their iPhone app.
2. The customer taps their contactless payment instrument on the iPhone.
3. The merchant's app submits the payload to Commerce Hub.
6. Commerce Hub attempts to process the transaction and sends the response to the merchantâ€™s app.
