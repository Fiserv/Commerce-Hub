# Tap to Pay SDK integrations

Tap to Pay allows merchants to accept contactless payments using a supported device or a partner-enabled app. Tap to Pay allows the merchant's app to accept payments from contactless credit or debit cards, digital wallets, smartwatches, and smartphones. No additional hardware is required to accept contactless payments through Tap to Pay, so merchants can accept payments from anywhere. Tap to Pay is offered using Commerce Hub's Terminal API SDKs for both Android and iOS.

**How it works:**

1. The merchant initiates a transaction from their devices app.
2. The customer taps their contactless payment instrument on the device.
3. The merchant's app submits the payload to Commerce Hub's Terminal API SDK.
4. Commerce Hub's SDK sends the payment information for processing.
5. Commerce Hub attempts to process the transaction and sends the response to the merchant's app.
