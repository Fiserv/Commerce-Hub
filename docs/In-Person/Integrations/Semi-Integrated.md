# Semi-Integrated



## Commerce Hub Semi-Integration Process

The API uses an asynchronous call model. Your point-of-sale initiates a request, Clover receives and processes the request, and then provides a response.

Our SDKs support sales, auths, pre-auths, tip adjusts, refunds, manual refunds, and other actions. By downloading a single library and installing our device drivers, you can connect and start taking payments in less than a day.
