# Semi-Integrated Device

Semi-integrated solutions run on a combination of Commerce Hub and third-party hardware. Commerce Hub's semi-integration solution allows your existing point-of-sale software to accept EMV based, PCI-compliant transactions. A semi-integration integrates your hardware and software with Commerec Hub's hardware and software, making your point-of-sale EMV compliant quickly and easily.
