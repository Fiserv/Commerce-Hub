# Contactless (NFC)

<!-- theme: danger -->
> We are enhancing Commerce Hub to include Contactless transaction support and the documents related to the features will be released soon.

Near Field Communication (NFC) or contactless payment are transactions made by tapping either a contactless chip card or payment-enabled device with a contactless-enabled terminal.

Contactless payments improves the customer's checkout experience and increases customer satisfaction while retaining the customer base. The merchant engages directly with their customers at the point-of-sale and provides a contactless payment experience.

- Better customer service - Contactless payment solution allows the customers to checkout easily and helps to speed up the transactions.
- Secure transactions - Paying with a contactless chip card or a payment-enabled device is secured by encrypting the payment source.
- Improved efficiency - Contactless payments reduce the handling of cash, making the transaction faster and more efficient.
- Assuring the business - Merchant accepting the contactless payment solution can strengthen their business for the next generation of payment technologies.
- No signature required - Removes the need to capture and validate a signature for merchants that have deployed contactless payments.
