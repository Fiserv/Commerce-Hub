# Contactless

<!-- theme: danger -->
> We are enhancing Commerce Hub to include Contactless transaction support and the documents related to the features will be released soon.

Contactless payments are transactions made by tapping either a contactless chip card or payment-enabled mobile or wearable device over a contactless-enabled payment terminal. Cards, phones, watches and other devices use the same contactless technology.

Contactless payments can both improve your checkout experience and may also increase customer satisfaction and help boost store loyalty. Because your business engages directly with customers at the point-of-sale and in your marketing and advertising, you play a critical role in helping create a positive contactless payment experience.

NFC contactless payment solution offers the following benefits to its customers:

- Better customer service - Tapping to pay allows your customers to checkout easily and to avoid touching surfaces and it only takes seconds, helping you speed up payments.
- Secure transactions - Tapping to pay with a contactless chip card or payment-enabled mobile or wearable device is a secure way to pay because each transaction generates a one-time code, just like contact EMV.
- Operational efficiency - Contactless payments improve throughput and reduce the handling of cash. Faster transaction times mean shorter lines and a lesser likelihood of abandoned sales.
- Future-proof your business - Investing in contactless now lays the groundwork for the next generation of payment technologies.
- No signature required - In 2018, Visa removed the need to capture and validate a signature for merchants that have deployed EMVÂ® chip technology. We continue to provide merchants with ways to reduce interaction in face-to-face transactions.
