## Benefits

- **Improved Customer Service:** Merchants can provide their customers a variety of payment choices worldwide and accept those payments through a single, convenient provider.
- **Payment Choices:** Allows merchants to provide their customers with choices to pay the way that they want, without incurring cross-border transaction fees
- **Single-source Global Partner:** Merchants are those that would like to streamline the number of acquiring relationships necessary to serve their global footprint. By relying on one payment service provider, for all electronic payments in all regions, merchants can also bypass many of the costs, risks and hassles of managing service providers in every country.
- **Single Integration:** Makes expansion into new markets, with direct merchant interfaces or third-party providers. A merchant integrates directly with Commerce Hub to authorize and settle all transactions across the globe. GMA merchants can also take advantage of numerous Commerce Hub product offerings.
- **Operational Efficiencies:** Streamline management of all global relationships through one single point-of-contact and reporting.
