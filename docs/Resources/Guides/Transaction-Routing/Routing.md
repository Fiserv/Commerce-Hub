# Transaction Routing

Commerce Hub offers multiple methods of transaction routing to enhance merchant processing, decrease decline rates, and reduce costs. When enabled for these services, transactions are sent in a standard [charges request](?path=docs/Resources/API-Documents/Payments/Charges.md) with no additional coding.
