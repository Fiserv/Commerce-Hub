# Vault Payments

When a payment method is stored in the Vault, the information is encrypted by the gateway and associated with a unique payment method token. This token can be used to create transactions without the [PCI compliance](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/) burden that comes with handling unencrypted data.

<!-- theme: warning -->
>Commerce Hub never store your customer's CVV in the Vault because it is expressly prohibited by card associations (e.g. Visa, Mastercard).

### Account Updater

[Account Updater](?path=docs/Resources/Guides/Vault/Account-Updater.md) is a feature that automatically requests updates for vaulted payment methods in the event that a customer's vaulted card expires or is replaced â€“ helping you avoid failed transactions or gaps in services provided to your customers.
