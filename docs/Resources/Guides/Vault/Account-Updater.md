# Account Updater

<!-- theme: danger -->
> We are enhancing the Commerce Hub to include Account Updater support. The documents related to the features will be released soon.

Account Updater is a feature that automatically requests updates for vaulted payment methods in the event that a customer's vaulted card expires or is replaced, helping the merchant avoid failed transactions or gaps in services provided to their customers.
