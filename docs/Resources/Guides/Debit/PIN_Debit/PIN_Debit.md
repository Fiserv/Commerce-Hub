# PIN Debit

Personal identification number or PIN Debit transaction is an electronic funds transfer from a customer’s bank to a merchant’s bank when the customer presents a bank-issued debit card and enters the PIN at the point of sale. Merchants must be set up by their merchant account provider to accept PIN debit transactions and will also need a pin-pad attached to their credit card terminal.

PIN debit cards look like credit cards, but function like electronic checks. Customers pull funds from their checking accounts rather than lines of credit.

The PIN debit transactions are secure as a PIN is a confidential code known only to the customer and card-issuing bank. When a customer pays with a PIN debit card, card data and PIN are transmitted securely through a merchant service provider and debit card network to the card-issuing bank, which checks on the availability of funds in the customer’s checking account. If there are sufficient funds and the PIN matches the PIN on file, the transaction is approved and the funds are electronically transferred from the customer’s account to the merchant’s bank. An interchange fee is attached to each transaction, requiring the merchant to pay the issuing bank a set amount (through a merchant service provider, who initially incurs the fee and passes it on to the merchant) for authorizing and settling the funds.

Commerce Hub supports the PIN debit card payments where the length of the PIN is determined by the customer's issuing bank. The minimum length of a PIN is 4 digits and the maximum length is 12 digits.

The benefits of a PIN debit transaction are:
- Pin based funds withdrwal cost less to process than Credit Cards.
- Becoming popular and widely used because of Pin-based security.
- Fast, convenient because they don’t require a signature.
- Ability to offer customers “Cash Back”.
- Transactions cannot be downgraded to Mid or Non Qualified rates.
- Virtually eliminates chargebacks and fraudulent transactions.
