# PIN Debit

A PIN Debit transaction is an electronic funds transfer from a customer's bank to a merchant's bank when the customer presents a bank-issued debit card and enters the PIN at the point of sale. Commerce Hub supports PIN debit transactions for charges, refunds and cancels.


<!-- theme: info -->
> Merchants must be set up by their merchant account provider to accept PIN debit transactions and will also need a PIN capable PIN-pad or terminal.
