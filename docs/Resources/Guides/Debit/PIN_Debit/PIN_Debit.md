# PIN Debit

A PIN [Debit](?path=docs/Resources/FAQs-Glossary/Glossary.md#debit) transaction is an electronic funds transfer from a customer's bank to a merchant's bank when the customer presents a bank-issued debit card and enters the [PIN](?path=docs/Resources/FAQs-Glossary/Glossary.md#pin) at the point of sale. Commerce Hub supports PIN debit transactions for charges, refunds and cancels.


<!-- theme: caution -->
> Merchants must be set up by their processor to accept PIN debit transactions and refunds. The merchant will also need a PIN capable PIN-pad or terminal.
