# API Element Mapping

<!-- theme: danger -->
>  The following documentation is only for **Payeezy** merchants that are upgrading to Commerce Hub. See [Getting Started](?path=docs/Getting-Started/Getting-Started-General.md) for Commerce Hub integration options.

The purpose of this page is to give developers an API element level mapping between the Payeezy and Commerce Hub platforms.  It includes value transformation rules where applicable.  _It does NOT contain all Payyezy API request and response elements; only those that are currently supported in Commerce Hub.  As new features and functionality are released in Commerce Hub, these documents will be updated._  

Documents can be downloaded by clicking on the links below.
