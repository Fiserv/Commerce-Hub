# Split Shipment

<!-- theme: danger -->
>  The following documentation is only for **Payeezy** merchants that are upgrading to Commerce Hub. See [Getting Started](?path=docs/Getting-Started/Getting-Started-General.md) for Commerce Hub integration options.

<br>

A split shipment is the ability to capture an authorization for the full order amount by performing a capture for each item shipped. Additional information on Commerce Hub split shipment functionality can be found [here](?path=docs/Resources/Guides/Split-Shipment.md).

<br>

> :memo: **Note:** It is important to know the platform you are transacting on in order to review the most pertinent information for your migration to Commerce Hub. <br> <br> If you are using the **/api.globalgatewaye4.firstdata.com** URL, then you are transacting through the **Payeezy Gateway Direct (PGW)** platform. <br> <br> If you are using the **/api.payeezy.com** URL, then you are transacting through the **Developer API** platform.

| Transacting Platform | Endpoint | Required Elements | Notes|
| -------- | ------------- | :--------------: |----------|
|Payeezy Gateway Direct | `transaction_type` = <br> 01 = Pre-Authorization <br> 32 = Tagged Pre-Authorization Completion  | XML: `SplitShipmentNumber` OR <br> JSON: `Split_Shipment` = xx/yy <br> where: xx = number of the shipment <br> and yy = total shipments| If yy is not known, then yy = total number of items in order. <br>  <br> If 01/01 value sent, Compass would reject the transaction. |
|Developer API | `transaction_type` = <br> Authorize <br> Split | `Split_Shipment` = xx/yy <br> where: xx = number of the shipment <br> and yy = total shipments| If yy is not known, then yy = 99.<br>  <br> If 01/01 value sent, Compass would reject the transaction. 
|Commerce Hub | Authorize:[/payments/v1/charges with captureFlag = "false‚Äù ](?path=docs/Resources/API-Documents/Payments/Charges.md) <br> Partial Capture: [/payments/v1/charges/{transactionId}/capture](?path=docs/Resources/API-Documents/Payments/Capture.md)   |   splitShipment { `totalCount`:5, `finalShipment`:true} within 'transactionDetails' object| `splitShipment` object can be sent in pre-authorization transaction, but is required for all captures. <br>  **2 Questions: 1. If total count unknown, what should a merchant use?  The max? 99?  2. Is total count = 1 accepted or rejected by gateway?**|
