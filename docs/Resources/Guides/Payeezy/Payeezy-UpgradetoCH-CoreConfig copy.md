# Configuration

<!-- theme: danger -->
> The following documentation is only for **Payeezy** merchants that are upgrading to Commerce Hub. See [Getting Started](?path=docs/Getting-Started/Getting-Started-General.md) for Commerce Hub integration options.

Configuration was previously accessed and managed via the Payeezy Real-time Payment Manager (RPM) and will now be available from ClientLine Enterprise (CLX).  For more details, please see [Commerce Hub Administration / ClientLine Enterprise Training](https://fiserv.cloudguides.com/en-us/guides/ClientLine%20Enterprise%20from%20Fiserv).

**General:**

Batch Settlement cutoff times configuration will not be available in the interface.

The API integration settings were originally controlled solely in RPM; in Commerce Hub, it will be controlled jointly in CLX and Dev Studio.

Partner API capabilities are currently not supported.

In Payeezy, the Administrative pages could be displayed in multiple languages (EN, ES) based on the terminal setting; at this time, CLX is available in English language only.

In Payeezy, re-authorizations for an expired initial authorization is automatically processed for the merchant at time of settlement.  This functionality is available in Commerce Hub, but must be enabled in the merchant configuration in Client Line Enterprise (CLX).
