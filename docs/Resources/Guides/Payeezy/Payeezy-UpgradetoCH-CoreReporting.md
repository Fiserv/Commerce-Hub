# Reporting

<!-- theme: danger -->
> The following documentation is only for **Payeezy** merchants that are upgrading to Commerce Hub. See [Getting Started](?path=docs/Getting-Started/Getting-Started-General.md) for Commerce Hub integration options.

## Reporting UI

Reporting was previously accessed via the Payeezy Real-time Payment Manager (RPM) and will now be available through ClientLine Enterprise (CLX).  For more details, please see [Commerce Hub Administration / ClientLine Enterprise Training](https://fiserv.cloudguides.com/en-us/guides/ClientLine%20Enterprise%20from%20Fiserv) .

In RPM, there were five pre-defined reports (Activity, Declined, Fraudulent, Deposits - Closed Batches, Deposits - Pending Batches) available with the ability to adjust the date ranges; the new solution, CLX, is a highly flexible reporting engine that allows you to create many customizable reports. 

In General, many more data elements are available for reporting in the new CLX solution than were previously available in RPM.  

### Format and Functionality Overview

|Function| RPM | CLX|
| :--------: | :------------- | :---------- |

### RPM Comparable Report Creation in CLX

To generate the comparable **RPM Activity** report in CLX, use the Reports --> Commerce Hub --> Generic Analysis menu item for a summarized report.  See Generic Analysis parameters in table below for information on inputs.  Drill-down capabilities to the transaction level are enabled on this report (via Reports --> Commerce Hub --> Search).  See Search parameters in table below.

To generate the comparable **RPM Declined** report in CLX, use the Reports --> Commerce Hub --> Generic Analysis menu item for a summarized report. Adjust 'Approval Status' filter to equal "Declined". See Generic Analysis parameters in table below for more information on inputs.  Drill-down capabilities to the transaction level are enabled on this report (via Reports --> Commerce Hub --> Search).  See Search parameters in table below.

> :memo: **Note:** The same information (Activity and Declined) can be generated by the Reports --> Authorizations --> Generic Analysis menu item, however, the scope of the report will contain all transactions, including those outside of Commerce Hub.  In order to isolate the results for Commerce Hub, Commerce Hub transacting MIDs must be added to the 'Site Heirarchy' Filter.

To generate the comparable **RPM Fraudulent** report in CLX, use the Data Solutions --> Fraud --> Manage menu item.  Select Reviews & Details in the Viewing drop-down list to show all transactions declined due to fraud configurations (settings, velocity controls and filters).

**RPM Deposits - Pending Batches** and **RPM Deposits - Closed Batches** reports are created based on systemic Payeezy batch processes, thus not able to be replicated in an exact manner in CLX.  In CLX, there is a robust Settlement report available for configuration and will provide authorization date, transaction date, batch date and funding date for all transactions.  Reports --> Settlement --> Search menu item.
