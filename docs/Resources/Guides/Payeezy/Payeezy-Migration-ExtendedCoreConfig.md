# Configuration

<!-- theme: danger -->
>  The following documentation is for **Payeezy** migration clients only. See [Getting Started](?path=docs/Getting-Started/Getting-Started-General.md) for Commerce Hub integration options.

Configuration was previously accessed via the Payeezy Real-time Payment Manager (RPM) and will now be available from ClientLine Enterprise (CLX).  For more details please see <link to CLX documentation/training>.

### General

Batch Settlement cutoff times can no longer be configured. 

A new API Password, HMAC Key and other API relation authorization and authentication was available self-serve in Payeezy RPM Administration and cannot be performed in CLX; <need to know where a merchant can do this self-service to a comparative analysis of that system can be performed>. 

There is more configuration available to a merchant admin in Marketplace for CommerceHub that was previously available to this role via Payeezy Gateway. 

Partner API capabilities are currently not supported and will be available in future releases

In Payeezy Gateway the Administrative pages could be displayed in multiple languages (EN, FR, ES) based on the terminal setting; at this time Marketplace is available in English language only.
