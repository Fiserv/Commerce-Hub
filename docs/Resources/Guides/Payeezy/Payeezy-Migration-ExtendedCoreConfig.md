# Configuration

<!-- theme: danger -->
>  The following documentation is for **Payeezy** migration clients only. See [Getting Started](?path=docs/Getting-Started/Getting-Started-General.md) for Commerce Hub integration options.

## General

- Configuration was previously accessed via the Payeezy Real-time Payment Manager (RPM) and will now be available from Marketplace.  For more details please see <link to Marketplace documentation/training>.
- Batch Settlement cutoff times can no longer be configured. 
- A new API Password, HMAC Key and other API relation authorization and authentication was available self-serve in Payeezy RPM Administration and cannot be performed in Marketplace; <need to know where a merchant can do this self-service to a comparative analysis of that system can be performed>. 
- There is more configuration available to a merchant admin in Marketplace for CommerceHub that was previously available to this role via Payeezy Gateway. 
- The ability to edit the terminal/MID address and create and edit users was available in Payeezy RPM Administration and will now be done in User Management inside BusinessTrack.
- Partner API capabilities are currently not supported and will be available in future releases
- Finally, in Payeezy Gateway the Administrative pages could be displayed in multiple languages (EN, FR, ES) based on the terminal setting; at this time Marketplace is available in English language only.

- Filter list by client
- Export user list
- Import user
- Action button on screen:
   - Reset Password
