# Configuration

<!-- theme: danger -->
>  The following documentation is for **Payeezy** migration clients only. See [Getting Started](?path=docs/Getting-Started/Getting-Started-General.md) for Commerce Hub integration options.

Configuration was previously accessed and managed via the Payeezy Real-time Payment Manager (RPM) and will now be available from ClientLine Enterprise (CLX).  For more details, please see [Commerce Hub Administration / ClientLine Enterprise Training](https://fiserv.cloudguides.com/en-us/guides/ClientLine%20Enterprise%20from%20Fiserv).

### General

Batch Settlement cutoff times configuration will not be available in the interface. 
 
The API integration settings were originally controlled solely in RPM; in Commerce Hub, it will be controlled jointly in CLX and Dev Studio.

Partner API capabilities are currently not supported.

In Payeezy, the Administrative pages could be displayed in multiple languages (EN, ES) based on the terminal setting; at this time CLX is available in English language only.
