# Virtual Terminal

<!-- theme: danger -->
>  The following documentation is only for **Payeezy** merchants that are upgrading to Commerce Hub. See [Getting Started](?path=docs/Getting-Started/Getting-Started-General.md) for Commerce Hub integration options.

## General

Virtual Terminal was previously accessed via the Payeezy Real-time Payment Manager (RPM) and will now be available from ClientLine Enterprise (CLX).  For more details, please see [Commerce Hub Administration / ClientLine Enterprise Training](https://fiserv.cloudguides.com/en-us/guides/ClientLine%20Enterprise%20from%20Fiserv).

In RPM, the Virtual Terminal functionality allows for Forced Post and Open Voids to be processed. In the CLX solution, Forced Post is not currently supported, but targeted for a future release (Q2 2023). Open Void is not supported in CLX.  

Features currently unavailable in CLX Virtual Terminal:

<ul>
  <li>The ability to add Soft Descriptors on an inititated transaction.</li>
  <li>Creating a copy of a prior Pre-Auth or Purchase.</li>
  <li>Initiating an ACH transation. At this time, card only is supported.  ACH release is targeted for Q2 2023.</li>
</ul>

RPM Virtual Terminal could be displayed in multiple languages (EN, FR, ES) based on the terminal setting; at this time, CLX Virtual Terminal is available in English language only.

## Element Level Differences

In CLX Virtual Terminal, the Currency is now required and defaults to USD.  In Payeezy, this value was pulled from the merchantâ€™s configuration. 

In CLX Virtual Terminal, the Card brand is selectable. If the full card number is entered first, the correct card type will be auto-populated.

The Country field is now free form text versus a drop down.

When processing secondary transactions (Completion/Capture, Void and Refund), the reference fields are editable in Payeezy Virtual Terminal but they are not editable in CLX Virtual Terminal.
