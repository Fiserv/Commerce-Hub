# Payeezy Migration

<!-- theme: danger -->
>  The following documentation is for **Payeezy** migration clients only. See [Getting Started](?path=docs/Getting-Started/Getting-Started-General.md) for Commerce Hub integration options.

Welcome to the Payeezy Merchant Migration Playbook.  The playbook is a site containing information to help you upgrade to the new Commerce Hub gateway. These articles provide guidance on the functional and technical differences between the systems. 

As Commerce Hub continues to grow and new features are added, the playbook will continue be expanded to cover the changes.
