# Mobile Wallets

<!-- theme: danger -->
>  The following documentation is only for **Payeezy** merchants that are upgrading to Commerce Hub. See [Getting Started](?path=docs/Getting-Started/Getting-Started-General.md) for Commerce Hub integration options.

Wallet transactions originate from a digital wallet either from a website or on a device (e.g. Apple/iOS, Google/Android, and Samsung). Merchants can submit this data as either an encrypted or a decrypted request.

- **Encrypted Wallet:** The merchant will send the encrypted data along with their private key and Commerce Hub will decrypt the information for processing.
- **Decrypted Wallet:** The merchant will decrypt the wallet data before submitting to Commerce Hub for processing.

> :memo: **Note:** All merchants upgrading to Commerce Hub, now have the opportunity to utilize Commerce Hub's decryption capabilities.
