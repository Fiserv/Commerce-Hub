# API Element Mapping

<!-- theme: danger -->
>  The following documentation is for **Payeezy** migration clients only. See [Getting Started](?path=docs/Getting-Started/Getting-Started-General.md) for Commerce Hub integration options.

The prurpose of this page is to give developers an API element mapping between Payeezy and Commerce Hub elements.  It includes value transformation rules where applicable.  _It does NOT contain all Payyezy API request and response elements; only those that are currently supported in Commerce Hub.  As new features and functionality are released in Commerce Hub, these documents will be updated._
