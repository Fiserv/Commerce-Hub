# Reporting

<!-- theme: danger -->
>  The following documentation is for **Payeezy** migration clients only. See [Getting Started](?path=docs/Getting-Started/Getting-Started-General.md) for Commerce Hub integration options.

Reporting was previously accessed via the Payeezy Real-time Payment Manager (RPM) and will now be available through ClientLine Enterprise (CLX).  For more details, please see [Commerce Hub Administration / ClientLine Enterprise Training](https://fiserv.cloudguides.com/en-us/guides/ClientLine%20Enterprise%20from%20Fiserv) .

In RPM, there were five pre-defined reports (Activity, Declined, Fraudulent, Deposits - Closed Batches, Deposits - Pending Batches) available with the ability to adjust the date ranges; the new solution, CLX, is a highly flexible reporting engine that allows you to create many customizable reports. 

In General, many more data elements are available for reporting in the new CLX solution than were previously available in RPM.  

## Format and Functionality Overview

|Function| RPM | CLX|
| :--------: | :------------- | :---------- |
|Scope| Information organized by terminal/outlet/MID <br><br> Shows summary with drill down to each transaction level detail <br>  <br>| Site ID is the equivalent element to MID in Commerce Hub <br> <br>  Use the Reporting --> Generic Analysis to create summarized reporting. Results displayed have drill-down capabilities into the underlying transactions (via Reporting --> Search).|
|Filters| Limited to date range, up to six months at a time | All RPM filters plus the extended ability to filter on all additional Commerce Hub elements and a date range of up to 25 months or predefined ranges |
|Delivery|  Download CSV <br> Email report <br> <br> Print <br>| Download as CSV, Excel or JSON <br> Email one-time <br> Schedule a report to email <br> _No print functionality from UI_|
|Actions| Sale transactions allow for Refund and New Transaction|Sale transactions allow for Refund and Void|

## RPM Comparable Report Creation in CLX

To generate the comparable **RPM Activity** report in CLX, use the Reports --> Commerce Hub --> Generic Analysis menu item for a summarized report.  See Generic Analysis parameters in table below for information on inputs.  Drill-down capabilities to the transaction level are enabled on this report (via Reports --> Commerce Hub --> Search).  See Search parameters in table below.

To generate the comparable **RPM Declined** report in CLX, use the Reports --> Commerce Hub --> Generic Analysis menu item for a summarized report. Adjust 'Approval Status' filter to equal "Declined". See Generic Analysis parameters in table below for more information on inputs.  Drill-down capabilities to the transaction level are enabled on this report (via Reports --> Commerce Hub --> Search).  See Search parameters in table below.

> :memo: **Note:** The same information (Activity and Declined) can be generated by the Reports --> Authorizations --> Generic Analysis menu item, however, the scope of the report will include all transactions including those outside of Commerce Hub.  In order to isolate the results for Commerce Hub, Commerce Hub transacting MIDs must be added to the 'Site Heirarchy' Filter.

To generate the comparable **RPM Fraudulent** report in CLX, use the Data Solutions --> Fraud --> Manage menu item.  Select Reviews & Details in the Viewing drop-down list to show all transactions declined due to fraud configurations (settings, velocity controls and filters).

**RPM Deposits - Pending Batches** and **RPM Deposits - Closed Batches** reports are created based on systemic Payeezy batch processes, thus not able to be replicated in an exact manner in CLX.  In CLX, there is a robust Settlement report available for configuration and will provide authorization date, transaction date, batch date and funding date for all transactions.  Reports --> Settlement --> Search menu item.

### Comparison of RPM Reporting Result Elements to CLX Reports

Commerce Hub offers a robust library of reporting APIs that includes Search (itemized data) and Summary level results.  For more details, please see [Commerce Hub Reporting](https://dev-developerstudio.fiserv.com/product/Reporting).

In the Payeezy Reporting API, parameters are sent in the url and results are sent back in XML format with a limit of 10k rows.  Commerce Hub has no limit on records returned.

Payeezy utilizes authentication per user. In Commerce Hub, authentication is by merchant.

In Payeezy, the reporting API was one endpoint and used a report_type parameter to select the information returned; in Commerce Hub, there are multiple available endpoints to retrive the information needed.

_*Closed Batches and Pending Batches reporting is generated based off systemic Payeezy batch processing functionality and cannot be replicated in Commerce Hub.  Robust settlement reporting will be available._

In Commerce Hub, the Endpoint [/v1/chub/search](https://dev-developerstudio.fiserv.com/product/Reporting/api/?type=post&path=/v1/chub/search) will provide a list of authorization transactions (pre-settle) and their attributes based on optional filter criteria. For more details on the expanded capabilities, please see [Commerce Hub Reporting](https://dev-developerstudio.fiserv.com/product/Reporting).

In Payeezy, parameters are sent in the url and the results are sent back in the CSV format with a limit of 10k rows per response.  Commerce Hub is an API request and response with no limit on records returned.

Payeezy utilizes authentication per user. Commerce Hub authentication is by merchant.

The Payeezy search allows filtering based on criteria related to cardholder name, reference numbers, transaction tags and full card numbers; Commerce Hub does not currently allow searching on those elements.  Commerce Hub allows filtering on payment method, networks, type, siteIDs and auth code in addition to first 6 and last 4 of the card number.   

Commerce Hub does provide a [summary search function](https://dev-developerstudio.fiserv.com/product/Reporting/api/?type=post&path=/v1/chub/summary).
