# Detect Fraud

## Overview

Commerce Hub offers an advance fraud detection service to help reduce fraudulent transactions, which in turn can help reduce chargebacks. This features allow merchants to create positive and negative lists for:

- IP Adress
- Credit Card Number (that is not tokenized)
- Email Address or Domain
- Reference Number
- Billing Address
- Country

We are enhancing Commerce Hub to include Fraud Detect support and the documents related to the features will be released soon.
