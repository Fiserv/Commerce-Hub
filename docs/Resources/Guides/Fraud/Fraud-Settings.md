# Fraud Best Practices

## Overview

Commerce Hub implements various fraud controls that allows merchant to monitor potentially fraudulent transactions, set filters and velocity controls, automatically accept or reject transactions based on those filters, and receive fraud reports. Unlike AVS and CVV filters, the Fraud Control filters will block transactions before any authorization attempt is made. The status of transaction is fraudulent when the certain fraud condition is hit.

We are enhancing Commerce Hub to include fraud best practices support and the documents related to the features will be released soon.
