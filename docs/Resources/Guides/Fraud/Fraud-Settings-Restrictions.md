# Transaction Restrictions

The Transaction Restriction settings can be enabled to detect and reject duplicate transactions. Duplicate transaction can be blocked based on timeframe, number of transactions, and transaction type. Enabling Transaction Restrictions in Commerce Hub will reject duplicate transactions once the specified configuration has been met.

Transaction Restrictions are setup inside of Merchant Configuration and Boarding _(Marketplace in the [ClientLine Enterprise Portal](https://www.businestrack.com))_. Filters are applied by attributes and their respective value.
