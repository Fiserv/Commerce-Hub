# Velocity Controls

Velocity settings determine which transactions Commerce Hub allows to proceed to authorization. A single transaction can be controlled by a minimum or maximum sale amount. Groups of transactions can be evaluated by time period or total dollar amount thresholds that, when exceeded, Commerce Hub will prevent all future transactions from processing. These controls allow a merchant to monitor / restrict transaction flow by IP address, by card number, and amount right down to the hour, per transaction type.

## Settings
