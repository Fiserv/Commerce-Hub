# Hybrid Card Routing

Commerce Hub allows a merchant to determine whether a [hybrid card](?path=docs/Resources/FAQs-Glossary/Glossary.md#hybrid-card) should be sent to the credit or debit network for processing. 

<!-- This can be setup in the Merchant Boarding and Configuration for all hybrid cards, or the merchant can manually override the routing by sending the `transactionCaptureType` in `transactionInteraction. -->

<!-- theme: warning -->
> We are enhancing Commerce Hub to include support for Hybrid Card Routing transactions and the documents related to this feature will be released soon.
