# Transaction Capture Type

Commerce Hub allows a merchant to determine the settlement type by defining the transaction capture type in the Merchant Boarding and Configuration, or the merchant can manually override the capture type by sending the `transactionCaptureType` in `transactionDetails`.

<!-- theme: warning -->
> We are enhancing Commerce Hub to include support for Transaction Capture Type and the documents related to this feature will be released soon.
