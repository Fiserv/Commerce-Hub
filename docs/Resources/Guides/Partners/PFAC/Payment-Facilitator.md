# Payment Facilitator

A payment facilitator _(PayFac)_ is a merchant service provider that simplifies the merchant account enrollment process. Small merchants that don't have the infrastructure to start accepting card payments are onboarded under a PayFac as a sub-merchant. A PayFac removes the friction in the application, onboarding, and integration process by simplifying it and tailoring it to the businesses they serve, enabling those businesses to begin accepting card payments more quickly.
