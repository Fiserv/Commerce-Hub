# Currency Conversion

<!-- theme: danger -->
> We are enhancing the Commerce Hub to include currency conversion support and the documents related to the features will be released soon.

## Dynamic Currency Conversion

Commerce Hub's Dynamic Currency Conversion service *(GlobalChoice)* is a payment solution that allows international customers to pay in either their credit card currency or the base currency of the Merchant. The DCC service authorizes and settles transactions in major global currencies while still being funded in the merchant's base currency. Both the customer and merchant will know precisely the amount of the sale in both currencies.

## Dynamic Pricing

With Dynamic Pricing, a consumer is offered the choice of payment currencies upon entering the merchant's website. After selecting the preferred currency, the merchant's website will display pricing in the chosen currency *(i.e. the cardholder's issuing bank's currency)* only. When the cardholder arrives at the checkout page, the transaction will continue to be represented in the chosen currency, through to the receipt/confirmation page. The final transaction amount will be displayed as a single currency amount in the cardholder's selected currency.

Global ePricing (GEP) requires one merchant processing account per each unique currency.  Merchants using GEP with Commerce Hub will be able to process one currency type through each outlet. Multiple currencies types will require multiple outlets.

Fiservâ€™s Dynamic Currency Conversion service (also known as GlobalChoice) is a payment solution that allows international customers to have the choice to pay for goods and services purchased online in their home currency while using their credit card for the payment. International Visa and MasterCard eCommerce customers can make informed decisions about their online purchases and avoid any unexpected pricing or foreign exchange conversions on receipt of their monthly statements.

If you use hosted forms for the payment process in your webshop and your Store has been activated for this product option, a currency choice is automatically provided to your customers if the card they use has been issued in a country with a currency that is different to your default currency.

## Currency Conversion Types

Commerce Hub provides 2 types of Currency Conversion requests, first is `Dynamic Currency Conversion Exchange Rate Request` in which you'll request the optimal currency and rate from our exchange rate provider, who will then determine which currency to provide a price and exchange rate in. And second one is `Dynamic Pricing Exchange Rate Request` in which you'll be provided with a list of currencies and prices. You can then choose certain prices and currencies to present to the customer, or customer can select the currency they would like to pay through.
