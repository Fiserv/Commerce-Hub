# Dynamic Currency Conversion

<!-- theme: danger -->
> We are enhancing the Commerce Hub to include currency conversion support and the documents related to the features will be released soon.

Commerce Hub's Dynamic Currency Conversion _(DCC)_ service is a payment solution that allows international customers to pay in either their credit card currency or the base currency of the merchant. The DCC service authorizes and settles transactions in major global currencies while still being funded in the merchant's base currency. Both the customer and merchant will know precisely the amount of the sale in both currencies.
