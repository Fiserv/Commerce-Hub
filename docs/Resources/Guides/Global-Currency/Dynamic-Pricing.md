# Dynamic Pricing

<!-- theme: danger -->
> We are enhancing the Commerce Hub to include currency conversion support and the documents related to the features will be released soon

With Dynamic Pricing _(DP)_, a consumer is offered the choice of payment currencies upon entering the merchant's website. After selecting the preferred currency, the merchant's website will display pricing in the chosen currency *(i.e. the cardholder's issuing bank's currency)*. When the customer arrives at the checkout page, the transaction will continue to be represented in the chosen currency, through to the receipt/confirmation page.
