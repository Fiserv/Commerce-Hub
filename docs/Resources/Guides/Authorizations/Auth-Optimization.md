# Authorization Optimization

Authorization Optimization from Commerce Hub helps businesses maximize their approval rates by preventing and recovering declines for E-commerce transactions. By combining adaptive rules based logic, using network account updater and leveraging partnerships with issuing banks ensuring higher approval rates. This is achieved by locating updated card numbers and/or expiration dates and retying the transaction with this new data.

### Supported Features

- Real time card account updater 
- Dynamic retry
