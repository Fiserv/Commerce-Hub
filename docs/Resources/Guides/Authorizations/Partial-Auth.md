# Partial Authorizations

<!-- theme: danger -->
> We are enhancing Commerce Hub to support partial authorizations and the documents related to the feature will be released soon.

<!--- Commerce Hub supports partial authorizations (approvals), authorization reversals, and balance response in order to improve in-person debit and prepaid transactions. Partial authorization capability addresses decline rates and enhances the consumer and merchant experience at the point of sale. -->

- **Partial Approvals:** allows merchants to process [split-tender](?path=docs/Resources/Guides/Split-Tender.md) charges by allowing an authorization request where the transaction amount exceeds the funds available on the card. The merchant can then process an additional charge to obtain the remaining amount.
- **Balance Response:** the merchant can inquire to the account balance information, leading to fewer declines.
- **Authorization Reversal:** will release the customer's authorization when partial approvals are not completed, releasing the customer's hold for future purchases.

<!-- theme: info -->
> Support for Partial Authorization is mandatory for all card brands. The value for `partialApproval` in `transactionDetails` is required for all card present transactions identifying the terminal is capable of partial authorization responses.
