# Split Shipment

A split shipment is an ability to [capture](?path=docs/Resources/API-Documents/Payments/Capture.md) an authorization for the full order amount by performing a capture for each item shipped.

Situations in which this could be implemented include:

- Shipment of goods will be split, the cardholder can be charged for each individual shipment.
- Occurs when the goods are not available for shipment at the time of the consumerâ€™s purchase.

<!-- theme: info -->
> If the customer cancels or refunds their order before the last shipment, the `finalShipment` indicator is required to be sent during the [refund](?path=docs/Resources/API-Documents/Payments/Refund.md) or [cancel](?path=docs/Resources/API-Documents/Payments/Cancel.md) request.

<!-- theme: warning -->
> If the authorization timeframe has expired, a [reauthorization](?path=docs/Resources/Guides/Authorizations/Re-Auth.md) is required.
