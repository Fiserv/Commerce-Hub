# Dynamic Descriptor

## Overview

A descriptor contains identifying information about a merchant, e.g. business name, phone number, city and/or state, which appears on customer's credit/debit card statement and identifies specific industry information based on the [Merchant Category Code (MCC)](?path=docs/Resources/FAQs-Glossary/Glossary.md#merchantcategroycode). The descriptor informs a customer of the merchant details and contact information.

The standard descriptor information that is passed through to the customer’s statement is the Doing Business As (DBA) name, customer service phone number and MCC that you provide with your merchant account application. See [hard descriptor](?path=docs/Resources/FAQs-Glossary/Glossary.md#harddescriptor) and [soft descriptor](?path=docs/Resources/FAQs-Glossary/Glossary.md#softdescriptor) for more information.

A [dynamic descriptor](?path=docs/Resources/FAQs-Glossary/Glossary.md#dynamicdescriptor) allows a merchant to associate a distinct description and phone number with different products or services. Many companies offer a variety of products or services and if a company name appears as the descriptor on customer's card statement rather than the name of the product or service, the customer may not recognize the charge as a result, customer disputes/[chargebacks](?path=docs/Resources/FAQs-Glossary/Glossary.md#chargeback) occur.
