# API Reporting

<!-- theme: danger -->
> We are enhancing Commerce Hub to support API Reporting and the documents related to the features will be released soon.

Commerce Hub supports reporting APIs to allow users to search the transaction records and to generate standard reports *(Activity, Closed Batches, Pending Batches, Declined)*. Merchants can use the reporting data to validate the payouts and the transactions settlement. The data also helps merchants to respond back to any chargeback or transaction related query, fraud detects etc.
