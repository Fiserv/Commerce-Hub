# API Reporting

<!-- theme: danger -->
>We are enhancing Commerce Hub to support API Reporting and the documents related to the features will be released soon.

The Commerce Hub reporting API allows users to search the transaction records and to generate standard reports (Activity, Closed Batches, Pending Batches, Declined). The data is returned in CSV format. Merchants can use the reporting data to validate the payouts and the transactions settlement. The data also helps merchants to respond back to any chargeback or transaction related query, fraud detects etc.
