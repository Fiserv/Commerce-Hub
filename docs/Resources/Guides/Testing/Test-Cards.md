# Test Cards

Commerce Hub allows merchants to test various forms of payments by providing test card data. Although no money will be processed while using a test account, merchants will most likely want to perform tests that simulate certain situations for different card brands.

A transaction error can also be triggered (for testing purposes) by entering an error code for the transaction amount.
