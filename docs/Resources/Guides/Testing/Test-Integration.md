# Test Response Messages

Commerce Hub allows developers to integrate with the API to trigger responses and to ensure that they are handled accordingly. 

## Test Cards

Commerce Hub supports [test cards](?path=docs/Resources/Guides/Testing/Test-Cards.md) in the sandbox environment. No funds will be charged, refunded or processed while utilizing a test account. 

## Error Response Testing

A transaction error can be triggered (for testing purposes) by entering the desired error code for the transaction. For more information, see [test errors](?path=docs/Resources/Guides/Testing/Test-Errors.md). 

## Decline Response Testing

A transaction decline can be triggered (for testing purposes) by entering a specific amount for the transaction. For more information, see [test declines](?path=docs/Resources/Testing/Test-Declines.md).

## Address and Security Code Testing

Address and security code verification responses can be triggered (for testing purposes) by entering a specific address or security code. For more information, see [test address and security code](?path=docs/Resources/Guides/Testing/Test-Address-Security.md).
