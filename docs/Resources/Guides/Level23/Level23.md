# Level II and III Data

<!-- theme: danger -->
> We are enhancing the Commerce Hub to include Level II and III purchase card support and the documents related to the features will be released soon.

Commerce Hub can pass Level II and III data (also knows as Enhanced Data) with business-to-business corporate and purchase card transactions. With a Level II and III data pass through solution, merchant's can meet card brand [data requirements](?path=docs/Resources/Guides/Level23/Level23-Data.md) and provide invoice-level transaction details and qualify for lower rates.
