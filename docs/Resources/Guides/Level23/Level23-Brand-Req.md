# Level II and III Brand Requirements

Card brands require specific data fields for [level II and III](?path=docs/Resources/Guides/Level23/Level23.md) transactions. Commere Hub supports Level II and III data for Visa and MasterCard, and supports Level II data for American Express.

Failure to submit required fields when submitting a [Level II](#level-ii) or [Level III](level-iii) transaction could result in a possible reject, reversal during settlement, or higher fees (billback).
