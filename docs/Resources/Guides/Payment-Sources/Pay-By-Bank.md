# Pay By Bank

Commerce Hub's Pay By Bank enables merchants to securely process payments directly from a customer's bank account. Pay by Bank is an ACH payment method that removes the needs to store sensitive bank data which provides enhanced security and convenience.

 With multiple acceptance methods available, including a virtual terminal and Commerce Hub APIs, merchants can accept both one-time and recurring payments, providing added flexibility and convenience for customers while minimizing processing costs and increasing sales opportunities.
