# Decrypted Wallet

<!-- theme: danger -->
> We are enhancing the Commerce Hub to include Decrypted Wallet support. The documents related to the features will be released soon.

*DecryptedWallet* is used by the merchant while sending the transaction to the Commerce Hub when they are using their own certificate to encrypt the data received from Apple Pay and Google Pay.
