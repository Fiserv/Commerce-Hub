# Decrypted Wallet

## Overview

*DecryptedWallet* is used by the merchant while sending the transaction to the Commerce Hub when they are using their own certificate to encrypt the data received from Apple Pay and Google Pay.

We are enhancing Commerce Hub and the documents related to the features will be released soon.
