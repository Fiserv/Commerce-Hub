# Using DecryptedWallet as a payment source

*DecryptedWallet* is utilized by merchants to securely transmit transaction data to Commerce Hub. By decrypting the digital wallet, a merchant has the ability to view the card data before submitting the transaction, giving them full control over the customerâ€™s payment journey.

 When merchants receive encrypted payment data from [Apple Pay](?path=docs/Online-Mobile-Digital/Wallets-AltPayments/Apple-Pay/Apple-Pay.md) and [Google Pay](?path=docs/Online-Mobile-Digital/Wallets-AltPayments/Google-Pay/Google-Pay.md), they use their own certificates to decrypt this data before sending it to Commerce Hub. It is recommended that a merchant uses their own certificate to encrypt the data before sending it to Commerce Hub.

<!-- theme: danger -->
> We are enhancing Commerce Hub to support [MUPK encrypted *DecryptedWallet*](?path=docs/Resources/Guides/Multi-Use-Public-Key/Multi-Use-Public-Key.md). Documentation related to this feature will be released soon.

**Digital wallet account types:**

- **Funding Primary Account Number *(FPAN)*:** The physical account number on the front of a credit or debit card.
- **Device Primary Account Number *(DPAN)*:** A device-specific token from the wallet provider that is associated with the FPAN.
