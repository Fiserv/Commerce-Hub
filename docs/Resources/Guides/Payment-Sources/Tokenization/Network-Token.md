# Network Token

Network tokenization is a method used in payment systems to enhance security by replacing sensitive cardholder data with unique tokens. These tokens are randomly generated and are only valid within a specific network or context, such as a particular merchant or transaction. This process helps reduce the risk of fraud and data breaches, as even if the token is intercepted, it cannot be used to make unauthorized transactions or reveal the original card data.
