# Paze digital wallet

Paze makes it easy for customers to make purchases by allowing them the ability to pay online without having to share their card details.

Commerce Hub offers merchants a simple, and secure way for their customers to easily provide the required checkout information. A customer's Paze digital wallet contains their card information and address information that can be used for shipping.

**How it works:**

1. The customer selects checkout from the merchant's app or website and is presented with the merchant's payment form.
2. The customer selects Paze and then redirected to the Paze UX.
3. The customer completes the Paze interaction and then redirected to the merchant's website.
4. The customer selects to complete the transaction.
5. The merchant submits the encrypted payload to Commerce Hub.
6. Commerce Hub attempts to process the transaction and sends the response to the merchant website.
