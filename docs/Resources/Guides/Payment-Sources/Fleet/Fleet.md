# Fleet Payments

Fleet cards and checks are a type of payment instrument that allows businesses to manage expenses associated with the vehicles that they own and operate. Fleet offers a range of benefits, including discounts on fuel purchases, comprehensive reporting tools, and fraud prevention measures to help businesses manage their fleet expenses effectively.

Depending on specific business needs and operational scope, businesses choose a fleet payment instrument for use by personnel operating company vehicles. The personnel can use the Fleet card or check to buy fuel, and non-fuel purchases such as auto parts, vehicle repairs, maintenance, etc or obtain cash.

Commerce Hub supports both card and check based transactions for Visa Fleet, Mastercard Fleet, Corpay *(formerly FleetCor; Fuelman, Fleetwide, Comdata Fleet, Express and ComCheck)*, Wright Express *(WEX, Over-The-Road (OTR) and Money Code, Next Generation Fleet Card (NGFC), Fleet One)*, Voyager, and Private Label *(proprietary)* cards.
