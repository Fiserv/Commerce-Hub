# State and Province Codes

State and province codes follow the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the International Organization for Standardization *(ISO)*, and defines codes for identifying the principal subdivisions *(states or provinces)* of all [countries in ISO 3166-1](?path=docs/Resources/Master-Data/Country-Code.md). Commerce Hub supports the use of the code or name in the [address details](?path=docs/Resources/Master-Data/Address.md), and the code only in the [customer](?path=docs/Resources/Master-Data/Customer-Details.md) and [vehicle](?path=docs/Resources/Master-Data/Vehicle-Details.md) details.
