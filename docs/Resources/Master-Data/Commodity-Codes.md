# Commodity Codes

Commodity codes are standard classification codes for products and services used to detail where money is spent within a company or organization. This information is submitted as part of [Level III line item data](?path=docs/Resources/Guides/Level23/Level23.md) and allows the following:

- Customer visibility of spend analysis
- Cost-effective procurement optimization
- Full usage of E-commerce capabilities
- International trade

There are multiple standard classification systems for merchandise trade: the Harmonized System _(HS)_, North American Industry Classification System _(NAICS)_, United Nations Standard Products and Services _(UNSPSC)_, National Institute of Government Purchasing _(NIGP)_, and Standard International Trade Classification _(SITC)_. Commerce Hub supports these standardized commodity code classification systems and will pass the information to the card brand for processing. See the following website for the most up to date list of commodity codes.
