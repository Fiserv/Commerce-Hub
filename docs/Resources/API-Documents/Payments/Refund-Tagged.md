# Tagged Refund

A tagged refund allows a merchant to maintain the transaction history in Commerce Hub by associating the refund to the original [charge request](?path=docs/Resources/API-Documents/Payments/Charges.md) by using the Commerce Hub transaction identifier or [merchant transaction identifier](?path=docs/Resources/Guides/BYOID.md).

<!-- theme: danger -->
> A refund request can be initiated against a [charge](?path=docs/Resources/API-Documents/Payments/Charges.md) only if it is already been [captured](?path=docs/Resources/API-Documents/Payments/Capture.md), otherwise submit a [cancel](?path=docs/Resources/API-Documents/Payments/Cancel.md) request.

##### Refund Types

Refunds can be initiated for the full amount or a partial amount of the original authorization.

- **Partial Refund:** A request submitted with the `amount` object for a partial `total`.
- **Full Refund:** Can be submitted without the `amount` object to refund the full `total`, or submitted with the `amount` object for the full `total`.

---

## Request Variables

A tagged refund request is initiated by sending the `referenceTransactionDetails` in the payload and may contain the 'amount' object based on the refund type.
