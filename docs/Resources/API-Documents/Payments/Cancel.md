# Process a void using the Cancels API

When a customer cancels the order or if fraud is suspected, the merchant will need to release the original authorization by issuing a cancel *(void)* request to the original Commerce Hub transaction identifier or [merchant transaction identifier](?path=docs/Resources/Guides/BYOID.md).

<!-- theme: warning -->
> A cancel request can be initiated against an [authorization](?path=docs/Resources/API-Documents/Payments/Charges.md) that has not been [captured](?path=docs/Resources/API-Documents/Payments/Capture.md), or a [sale](?path=docs/Resources/API-Documents/Payments/Charges.md) that has not been settled *(batched)*, otherwise submit a [reversal request](?path=docs/Resources/API-Documents/Payments/Refund.md).

**Cancel types:**

Cancels can be initiated for the full amount or a partial amount of the original authorization.

- **Partial:** A request submitted with the `amount` object for a partial `total`.
- **Full:** Can be submitted without the `amount` object to cancel the full `total`, or submitted with the `amount` object for the full `total`.

<!-- theme: info -->
> Commerce Hub currently only supports partial cancels for [terminal direct](?path=docs/Resources/FAQs-Glossary/Glossary.md#direct-capture) and [gateway](?path=docs/Resources/FAQs-Glossary/Glossary.md#gateway-capture) settlement on the Nashville front-end processor.

| **Canadian debit only** | |

 <!---
| *PARTIAL*| A reversal transaction where the amount is less than the original authorization amount. |
