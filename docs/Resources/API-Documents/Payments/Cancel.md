# Cancel

If the customer cancels the order or if fraud is suspected, the merchant will need to release the original authorization by issuing a cancel (void) request to the original `transactionId` or `orderId`.

<!-- theme: warning -->
> A cancel request can be initiated against an [authorization](?path=docs/Resources/API-Documents/Payments/Charges.md) that has not been [captured](?path=docs/Resources/API-Documents/Payments/Capture.md), or a [sale](?path=docs/Resources/API-Documents/Payments/Charges.md) that has not been settled (batched), otherwise submit a [refund](?path=docs/Resources/API-Documents/Payments/Refund.md) request.

---

## Minimum Requirements

Cancel request can be initiated by sending the request to the appropriate endpoint by providing valid `transactionId` or `orderId` along with the `reversalReasonCode` in `transactionDetails` object. The full request schemas are available in our [API Explorer](../api/?type=post&path=/payments/v1/cancel).

#### Reversal Reason Code

The below table identifies the valid values of the reason the merchant/customer requests for cancel(void).

| Value | Description |
|---------|---------|
|*VOID* | A transaction that is used to cancel or fully reverse a previous transaction. |
|*SUSPECTED_FRAUD* | A transaction that is voided for suspected fraud. |
|*TIMEOUT* | This transaction is used when the merchant does not receive a response to a transaction. At that point it is unknown whether the host received the transaction or not; therefore a timeout reversal request must be submitted. Upon the successful completion of the timeout reversal, the original transaction may be sent again. |
|*TIMEOUT_REVERSAL*| A Timeout Reversal of a Void/Full Reversal |
|*PARTIAL*| A reversal transaction where the amount is less than the original authorization amount. |
|**Canadian Debit Only**| |
|*EDIT_ERROR* | Edit Error Parse error at the terminal |
|*MAC_VERIFICATION_ERROR* | MAC Verification Error terminal MAC is invalid or data used to verify the MAC is incorrect. |
|*MAC_SYNCH_ERROR* | MAC Synch Error terminal MAC is out of synch with host MAC |
|*ENCRYPTION_ERROR* | Message Encryption Error terminal message encryption key is out of synch with host message encryption key or there is an error with the input data. |
|*SYSTEM_ERROR* | System Error all other errors except for timeout (no response received) such as communication errors between the terminal and the PIN pad. |
