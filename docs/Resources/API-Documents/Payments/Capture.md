# Capture

Use this payload to capture a previous pre-authorized [Charge](?path=docs/Resources/API-Documents/Payments/Charges.md). This is known as a post-authorization. This will settle (withdrawl) funds from the customer.

<!-- theme: warning -->
> Issuers have different hold times for pre-authorizations. If the authorization has been released it is recommended to process a new charge.

#### Capture Types

- **Automatic Capture:** A charge is automatically captured when a [Sale](?path=docs/Resources/FAQs-Glossary/Glossary.md#sale) or [Deferred Payment](?path=docs/Resources/Guides/Bill-Payments/Deferred-Payment.md) request is made.
- **Manual Capture:** A manual capture can be processed for the full amount or a partial amount.
  - **Full:** A full capture request will settle the full amount of the held funds. This amount can be for more than the amount for certain industries (e.g., tips).
  - **Partial:** A partial capture request is used when the full pre-auth amount is not needed or when submitting a [Split Shipment](?path=docs/Resources/Guides/Split-Shipment.md). When the full amount is not captured, then the remaining balance is released to the customer (e.g., the price of a pre-order item decreases before shipping).
