# Refund

If the customer returns product or requests to cancel the transaction after the batch has been settled, the merchant will need to release the original authorization by issuing a refund request to the original `transactionId` or `orderId`. Refunds can be initiated for the full amount or a partial amount of the original authorization.

<!-- theme: danger -->
>Refund Request can be initiated against a [charge](?path=docs/Resources/API-Documents/Payments/Charges.md) only if it is already been [captured](?path=docs/Resources/API-Documents/Payments/Capture.md) and settled, otherwise submit a [cancel](?path=docs/Resources/API-Documents/Payments/Cancel.md) request.

<!-- theme: warning -->
> Based on the issuing bank timeframe, refund may take 3-5 days to process and reflect on the account.

---

## Minimum Requirements

A refund request can be initiated by sending the request to the appropriate endpoint by providing valid `transactionId` or `orderId`. The request may contain the `amount` object based on the refund type.

#### Refund Types

- **Partial Refund:** A request submitted with the `amount` object for a partial `total`.
- **Full Refund:** Can be submitted without the `amount` object to refund the full `total`, or submitted with the `amount` object for the full `total`.


#### amount

The below table identifies the required parameters in the `amount` object.

|Variable |  Type| Maximum Length | Description |
|---------|----------|----------------|---------|
| `total` | *number* | 12 | Total amount of the transaction. [Subcomponent](?path=docs/Resources/Master-Data/Amount-Components.md) values must add up to total amount. |
| `currency` | *string* | 3 | The requested currency in [ISO 3 Currency Format](?path=docs/Resources/Master-Data/Currency-Code.md).|
