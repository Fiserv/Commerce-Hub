# Refunds

If the customer returns a product or requests to cancel the transaction after the transaction has been captured, the merchant will need to return the funds by issuing a refund request.

<!-- theme: warning -->
> Based on the issuing bank timeframe, refunds may take 3-5 days to process and reflect on the customer's account unless enabled for authorization refunds.

## Authorized Refunds

Commerce Hub supports the card brands acceptance rules that require a merchant to send an authorization message on refund transactions, also known as an authorized _(online)_ refund. These authorization messages will enable issuers to update the customer's account in real-time.

<!-- theme: info -->
> Authorized refunds are not supported on all settlement platforms. Please contact your account representative for more information.

<!-- theme: danger -->
> Refund requests can be initiated against a [charge](?path=docs/Resources/API-Documents/Payments/Charges.md) only if it is already been [captured](?path=docs/Resources/API-Documents/Payments/Capture.md), otherwise submit a [cancel](?path=docs/Resources/API-Documents/Payments/Cancel.md) request.
