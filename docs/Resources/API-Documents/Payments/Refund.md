# Refunds

If the customer returns a product or requests to cancel the transaction after the batch has been settled, the merchant will need to return the funds by issuing a refund request.

<!-- theme: warning -->
> Based on the issuing bank timeframe, refunds may take 3-5 days to process and reflect on the customer's account.

#### Authorized Refunds 

Commerce Hub supports Visa, Mastercard, and Discover acceptance rules that require a merchant to send an authorization message on refund transactions. These authorization messages will enable issuers to update the customer's account in real-time.

#### Refund Types

Refunds can be initiated for the full amount or a partial amount of the original authorization.

- **Partial Refund:** A request submitted with the `amount` object for a partial `total`.
- **Full Refund:** Can be submitted without the `amount` object to refund the full `total`, or submitted with the `amount` object for the full `total`.

<!-- theme: danger -->
> Refund Request can be initiated against a [charge](?path=docs/Resources/API-Documents/Payments/Charges.md) only if it is already been [captured](?path=docs/Resources/API-Documents/Payments/Capture.md) and settled, otherwise submit a [cancel](?path=docs/Resources/API-Documents/Payments/Cancel.md) request.
