# Cancel Using the URI

<!-- theme: danger -->
> Cancels using the URI is being sunset in favor of [cancels](?path=docs/Resources/API-Documents/Payments/Cancel.md) using a referenced transaction identifier.

A cancel request is initiated by sending the `transactionId` in the URI and may contain the `amount` object based on the cancel type.

<!-- theme: warning -->
> A cancel request can be initiated against an [authorization](?path=docs/Resources/API-Documents/Payments/Charges.md) that has not been [captured](?path=docs/Resources/API-Documents/Payments/Capture.md), or a [sale](?path=docs/Resources/API-Documents/Payments/Charges.md) that has not been settled (batched), otherwise submit a [refund](?path=docs/Resources/API-Documents/Payments/Refund.md) request.

### Request Variables

## Reversal Reason Code

The below table identifies the valid values of the reason the merchant/customer requests for cancel(void).

| Value | Description |
|---------|---------|
| *VOID* | A transaction that is used to cancel or fully reverse a previous transaction. |
| *SUSPECTED_FRAUD* | A transaction that is voided for suspected fraud. |
| *TIMEOUT* | This transaction is used when the merchant does not receive a response to a transaction. At that point it is unknown whether the host received the transaction or not; therefore a timeout reversal request must be submitted. Upon the successful completion of the timeout reversal, the original transaction may be sent again. |
| *CARD_OVERRIDE* | A transaction that is reversed by the terminal, normally due to a chip card override. | 
| **Canadian Debit Only** | |
| *EDIT_ERROR* | Edit Error Parse error at the terminal |
| *MAC_VERIFICATION_ERROR* | MAC Verification Error terminal MAC is invalid or data used to verify the MAC is incorrect. |
| *MAC_SYNCH_ERROR* | MAC Synch Error terminal MAC is out of synch with host MAC |
| *ENCRYPTION_ERROR* | Message Encryption Error terminal message encryption key is out of synch with host message encryption key or there is an error with the input data. |
| *SYSTEM_ERROR* | System Error all other errors except for timeout (no response received) such as communication errors between the terminal and the PIN pad. |
 
 
 <!---
| *PARTIAL*| A reversal transaction where the amount is less than the original authorization amount. |
