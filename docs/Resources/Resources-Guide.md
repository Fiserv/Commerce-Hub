### Dynamic Descriptor

A descriptor contains identifying information about a merchant, e.g. business name, phone number, city and/or state, which appears on customer's credit/debit card statement and identifies specific industry information based on the [Merchant Category Code (MCC)](?path=docs/Resources/FAQs-Glossary/Glossary.md#merchantcategroycode).

### Vault

When a payment method is stored in the [Vault](?path=docs/Resources/Guides/Vault/Vault-Overview.md), the information is encrypted by the gateway and associated with a unique payment method token.
