# Secure Data Capture

Commerce Hub offers online integration methods for E-commerce merchants that require SAQ A and SAQ A-EP compliance.

The PCI DSS [Self-Assessment Questionnaires](?path=docs/Resources/FAQs-Glossary/Glossary.md#self-assessment-questionnaire) (SAQs) are self-validation tools intended to assist merchants in evaluating their compliance with the PCI DSS. For more information visit [PCI Security Standard](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/) website.

- **SAQ A:** applies to the merchants that have fully outsourced all cardholder data functions to Commerce Hub, with no electronic storage, processing, or transmission of any cardholder data on their systems.

- **SAQ A-EP:** applies to the merchants who partially outsource payment processing to Commerce Hub. The merchant typically has a website that hosts a checkout process and sends the cardholder data to Commerce Hub at a point of payment.
