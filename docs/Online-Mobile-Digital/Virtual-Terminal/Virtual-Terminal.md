# Virtual-Terminal

## Overview

A merchant may be required to process and offline transaction or may need to manually process a secondary transaction, e.g. to take orders via phone or process a cancel, refund, capture, etc.

The Virtual Terminal can also be used and for creating [Payment URLs](../Payment-URL/Payment-URL.md) that allow consumers to make the payment at a later point.
