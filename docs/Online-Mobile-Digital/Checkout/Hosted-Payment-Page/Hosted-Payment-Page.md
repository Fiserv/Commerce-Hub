# Create a Payment Form

<!-- theme: danger -->
> We are enhancing Commerce Hub to include Hosted Payment Page support and the documents related to the features will be released soon.

Allows a merchant to redirect their customer to a secure Commerce Hub Hosted Payment Page to process a transaction. The Commerce Hub Hosted Payment Page manages the customer interactions that are required in the checkout process based on payment method, or authentication mechanisms (3-D Secure).

This gives merchants the option to use our secure hosted pages or an embeddable form which can reduce the burden of compliance with the Data Security Standard of the Payment Card Industry (PCI DSS).

<!-- theme: info -->
> A merchant can lessen the PCI DSS load by using Hosted Payment Pages, and still make use of our extended capabilities using our RESTful APIs to access features where no direct consumer interaction is required and no sensitive data been processed.
