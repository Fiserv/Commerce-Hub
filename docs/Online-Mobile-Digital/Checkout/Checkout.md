## Mobile integrations information

Commerce Hub's Checkout solutions are supported for mobile integrations through WebViews that can be served with a mobile device or through secure APIs that can be offered as client to server APIs from a native mobile application, as browser to server APIs from a HTML5 or REACT application or from as Server to Server APIs from a web or mobile app server.

Merchant's and developers that use a WebView for their mobile apps can qualify for SAQ A PCI compliance scope. Merchants that use a client to server or browser to server API can qualify for SAQ A-EP PCI compliance scope. And merchants that use server to server APIs can qualify for SAQ-D PCI compliance scope.

Mobile integrations are supported with the following conditions:

- The merchant's API should provide access to the web app via a native mobile browser or a WebView embedded within a native mobile app. See [Apple's iOS](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkwebview) or [Google's Android](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView) documentation for additional details.
- Commerce Hub's Checkout solutions are responsive and should natively re-render to the customer's device screen size.
- When integrating with native iOS or Android SDKs, [Commerce Hub's API solutions](?path=docs/Resources/API-Documents/Use-Our-APIs.md) should be used.
