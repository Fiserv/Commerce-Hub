# Apple Pay on the Web: Hosted Payment Page

<!-- theme: danger -->
> We are enhancing Commerce Hub to include Apple Pay Hosted Payment Page support and the documents related to the features will be released soon.

Commerce Hub's Hosted Payment Page integration removes the PCI Compliance requirement on the merchant server by handling the payment processing form on Commerce Hub's secure server. The merchant can customize the look and feel of the payment form.

### How it Works

1. The customer selects checkout from the merchant's website and Commerce Hub's secure Hosted Payment Page displays.
2. The customer selects Apple Pay and the Apple Pay payment form displays.
3. The customer completes the Apple Pay form and returns to the Hosted Payment Page.
4. The customer selects to complete the transaction.
5. The Hosted Payment Page submits the encrypted Apple Pay payload to Commerce Hub.
6. Commerce Hub attempts to process the transaction and sends the response to the merchantâ€™s website.
