# Apple Pay on the Web: RESTful API Integration

Commerce Hub's RESTful API integration allows the merchant to create a custom UI integration with Apple Pay. The merchant will host the payment processing on their server and has full control over the look and feel. 

<!-- theme: warning -->
> Merchants are required to have the relevant Payment Card Industry (PCI) Compliance capabilities to process and store card data.

### How it Works

1. The customer selects checkout from the merchant's website and the merchant’s payment form displays.
2. The customer selects Apple Pay and the Apple Pay payment form displays.
3. The customer completes the Apple Pay form and returns to the merchant's website.
4. The customer completes the transaction.
5. The merchant’s website submits the encrypted Apple Pay payload to Commerce Hub.
6. Commerce Hub attempts to process the transaction and sends the response to the merchant’s website.

## Step 1: Configure Apple Pay

Configure Apple developer account with merchant information to accept [Apple Pay on the web](https://help.apple.com/developer-account/#/dev1731126fb). This includes creating a merchant identifier, processing certificate, registering the merchant and creating a merchant identity certificate.

- When using *ApplePay*, the merchant will utilize `applePayMerchantId` and the [certificate](?path=docs/Resources/Guides/Dev-Studio/Certificate-Management.md) generated by Commerce Hub.
- When using *DecryptedWallet*, the merchant will utilize their own certificate.

---

## Step 2: Support Apple Pay on the Web

The merchant can start supporting Apple Pay on their website by using the Commerce Hub's [RESTful API](?path=docs/Resources/API-Documents/Use-Our-APIs.md) with [Apple Pay's JS API Framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_pay_on_the_web/apple_pay_js_api).

---

## Step 3: Presenting the Payment Sheet

The merchant can enhance the purchase experience from their website by creating a streamlined checkout process and presenting a customized Apple Pay payment sheet that allows customers to promptly authorize a payment and complete their transaction. Refer to Apple's website on how to customize the [payment sheet](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/apple-pay/overview/checkout-and-payment/#customize-the-payment-sheet).

---

## Step 4: Submit a Payment Request

- [**Encrypted Data:**](#request-variables) The data is encrypted using Apple's encryption and Commerce Hub will decrypt the information.
- [**Decrypted Wallet:**](?path=docs/Resources/Guides/Payment-Sources/Decrypted-Wallet.md) The data is encrypted and decrypted using a merchant's certificate and the card data is submitted to Commerce Hub.
