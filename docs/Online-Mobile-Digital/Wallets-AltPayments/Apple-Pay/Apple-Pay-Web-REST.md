# Apple Pay on the Web: RESTful API Integration

## Step 1: Configure Apple Pay on the Web

Configure Apple developer account with merchant information to accept [Apple Pay on the web](https://help.apple.com/developer-account/#/dev1731126fb). This includes creating a merchant identifier, creating a processing certificate, registering the merchant and creating a merchant identity certificate.

- When using *ApplePay*, the merchant will utilize the certificate generated by Commerce Hub. Please contact our Account Representative in order to get the certificate.
- When using *DecryptedWallet*, the merchant will utilize their own certificate.

---

## Step 2: Support Apple Pay on the Web

The merchant can start supporting Apple Pay on their website by using the Commerce Hub's [RESTful API](docs/Resources/API-Documents/Use-Our-APIs.md) with [Apple Pay's JS API Framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_pay_on_the_web/apple_pay_js_api).

---

## Step 3: Presenting the Payment Sheet

The merchant can enhance the purchase experience from their website by creating a streamlined checkout process and presenting a customized Apple Pay payment sheet that allows customers to promptly authorize a payment and complete their transaction. Refer to Apple's website on how to customize the [payment sheet](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/apple-pay/overview/checkout-and-payment/#customize-the-payment-sheet).

---

## Step 4: Submit a Payment Request

- Option 1 - Encrypted Data (wallet encrypted data using apple encryption, commerce hub will decrypt)
- Option 2 - Decrypted Wallet (Merchant using their own certificate and they decrypt themselves and send us card data)
