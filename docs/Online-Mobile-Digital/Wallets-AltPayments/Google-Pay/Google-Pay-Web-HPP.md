# Google Pay Web: Hosted Payment Page

<!-- theme: danger -->
> We are enhancing Commerce Hub to include Google Pay support with Hosted Payment Page and the documents related to the features will be released soon.

Commerce Hub's Hosted Payment Page integration removes the PCI Compliance requirement on the merchant server by handling the payment processing form on Commerce Hub's secure server. The merchant can customize the look and feel of the payment form.
