# Samsung Pay

Samsung Pay is a digital wallet platform and online payment system developed by Samsung to power in-app and tap-to-pay purchases on mobile devices, enabling users to make payments with Android OS on phones, tablets or watches. The app comes pre-installed in Samsung devices. Shoppers can add payment cards on their Samsung Pay app and then use the app to make online or in store payment.
