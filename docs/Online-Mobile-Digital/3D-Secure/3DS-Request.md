# 3-D Secure Request

<!-- theme: danger -->
> We are enhancing Commerce Hub to support the Private Label and the documents related to the features will be released soon.

Commerce Hub allows a merchant to pass the 3-D Secure authentication results that were obtained through a Commerce Hub or a thrid-party 3-D Secure (3DS) provider when sending the authorization transaction. *PaymentCard* or *PaymentToken* is used by the merchant as the payment source when sending the transaction to the Commerce Hub, along with the 3DS response data.

<!-- theme: warning -->
> Merchants are required to have the relevant Payment Card Industry (PCI) Compliance capabilities to process and store card data.
