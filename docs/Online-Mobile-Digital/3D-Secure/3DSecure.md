# 3-D Secure

## Overview

3-D Secure is a protocol designed to be an additional security layer for online credit and debit card transactions. The name refers to the "three domains" which interact using the protocol: the merchant/acquirer domain, the issuer domain, and the interoperability domain.

When using our payments API as the 3-D Secure provider, the authentication is performed in-line with the existing transaction flow. The process starts by performing a typical authorization or sale request with a desire to perform 3-D Secure authentication in the request.

The authorization is then placed into a WAITING status until the authentication process is completed. During authentication, the merchant may be required to update the original transaction request one or more times in order to move the process flow forward.

At the end of the authentication process, the original transaction is updated with the authentication results and the authorization is completed.

#### Transaction Types

3DS transactions originate from a either a merchant 3DS service or through Commerce Hub's 3DS Authentication service. Merchants can submit this data as either a passthrough or a authentication request.
