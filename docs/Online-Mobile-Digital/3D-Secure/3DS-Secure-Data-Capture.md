# 3-D Secure - Secure Data Capture Integration

<!-- theme: danger -->
> We are enhancing Commerce Hub to support the 3-D Secure and the documents related to the features will be released soon.

Commerce Hub's Secure Data Capture is designed to work seemlessly with our 3-D Secure (3DS) authentication provider. This eliminates the need to manually integrate with the provider's API and increases PCI security. The [iFrame](?path=docs/Online-Mobile-Digital/Secure-Data-Capture/iFrame-JS/iFrame-JS.md) or [Javascript SDK](?path=docs/Online-Mobile-Digital/Secure-Data-Capture/Payment-JS/Payment-JS.md) handles the data collection and storage to send to the 3DS provider.

#### Transaction Flow

1. The customer navigates to checkout page of the merchant's website.
2. The customer's browser loads the Commerce Hub iFrame or JS SDK.
3. The Commerce Hub builds and renders an a card form that allows the customer to initiate the payment session.
4. The customer's details are entered and stored against a sessionID within Commerce Hub on form submit.
5. Upon a successful card capture, Commerce Hub will initiate a device capture with the 3DS provider.
6. Upon a scuccesful device capture, the merchant's website will attempt an authentication call via the merchant's backend server.
7. Upon a successful autnetication, the merchant's website will attempt to process the charges/tokens transaction via the merchant's backend server.
8. Commerce Hub sends the transaction response to the merchant's website.
